            Hello! My username is Hri7566. I am a hobbyist software developer.
            I make websites and miscellaneous apps. I write most of my projects
            in TypeScript and C.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            If you would like to talk about job opportunities or just want to
            reach out, you can contact me on Discord. You can try my Gmail or
            Twitter, but I don't check those as often. I check Discord just
            about hourly, so that's why I suggest it. Also, I tend to reply to
            a lot of YouTube comments within a day or two. If you have my phone
            number, texting me would be adequate.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I'm a major contributor (debatably) to Multiplayer Piano and MPP.net
            and have created hundreds of scripts and projects centered around it,
            though most are deprecated and experimental. You can read more these
            ventures <a href="https://github.com/Hri7566/mppclone">here</a>.
