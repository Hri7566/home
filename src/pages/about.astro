            Hello! My username is Hri7566. I am a senior software developer. I
            make goofy websites and video games. I put a lot of effort into my
            personal projects.

            If you would like to talk about job opportunities or just want to

        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I'm a major contributor and backend developer of MultiplayerPiano.net
            and have created hundreds of scripts and projects centered around it.
            It's where I grew up on the internet, and I'm happy to be a part of
            what it's become today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I am a skilled web designer and have made websites for a few clients
            and for my own use. I'm also experienced in game development and
            I am working on a few games, but I am not ready to share them yet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I'm also a musician and I play a lot of music. I'm not a professional
            musician, but I like to experiment with new sounds and I'm always
            looking for new ways to make music. I mainly use Logic Pro X and
            Sunvox for my sound design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I made an album called Space Tunes that I released on my Bandcamp
            page. I made it over the course of two days and I made it as an
            experiment to see if I could make music that I like, and I'm happy
            with the result. You can listen to it <a href="https://hri7566.bandcamp.com/album/space-tunes">here</a>.
