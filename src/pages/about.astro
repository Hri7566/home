            Hello! My username is Hri7566. I currently have no job and I am
            struggling to survive as a hobbyist developer. I make websites and
            miscellaneous apps. I like to use Next.js most of the time, but I
            have recently taken a liking towards Astro. As a matter of fact,
            this very site was migrated from Next to Astro!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            If you would like to talk about job opportunities or just want to
            reach out, you can contact me on Discord. You can try my Gmail or
            Twitter, but I don't check those as often. I check Discord just
            about hourly, so that's why I suggest it. Also, I tend to reply to a
            lot of YouTube comments within a day or two.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-gray-300">
            I'm a major contributor (debatably) to MPP/MPP.net and have created
            many scripts and projects centered around it. You can read more
            about it <a href="https://github.com/Hri7566/mppclone">here</a>.
