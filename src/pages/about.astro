            Hello! My username is Hri7566. I currently have no job and I am
            struggling to survive as a hobbyist developer. I make websites and
            miscellaneous apps and tools completely for fun and I have earned
            just about nothing for my work. I like to use Next.js most of the
            time, but I have recently taken a liking towards Astro. As a matter
            of fact, this very site was migrated from Next to Astro!

            If you would like to talk, you can contact me on Discord. You can
            try my Gmail or Twitter, but I don't check those as often. I check
            Discord just about hourly, so that's why I suggest it. Also, I tend
            to reply to a lot of YouTube comments within a day or two.

            I'm a major contributor (debatably) to MPP/MPPClone and have created
            many scripts and projects centered around it. You can read more
            about it <a
